Introduction
============

> Sic transit gloria mundi.

This repo contains the following:

- My dotfiles (`dotfiles/`, `emacs.d`, etc)
- My Linux setups
- Supporting scripts and files
- Some other goodies

If you want to use any part of my configurations, you're free to do so,
but **do not** try to use it as a whole, it's complex and personal,
and some additional secret stuff is not included, so it won't work
reliably. Just cherry-pick what you want.

Installation
============

System setup
------------

The configuration on this repo works with multiple OS / hardware
setups, which have their own set up instructions.  Follow the links
below for more details.

- [Linux desktop workstation](systems/itugen/) (`itugen`) with
  latest stable Debian with MATE desktop.

- [Linux laptop](systems/ulgen/) (`ulgen`) using the
  latest stable Linux Mint Cinnamon.

- [Raspberry Pi](systems/ayata/) (`ayata`) backup and print/scan
  server.

Post-install
------------

The following commands help complete the installation, regardless of the
system flavour.  Execute these **before logging in to the graphical
session**, in a virtual console shell:

    $ git clean -dfx       # in case the repo is dirty,
                           # commit beforehand if necessary.
    $ make setup build

Afterwards, the junk that `bin/invade` creates can be cleaned up
like this:

    $ find $HOME/ -name '*,invaded~' -exec rm -r \{\} \+

Now, you can log in to the graphical session.

For the user session to function as intended, you will need to log out and
log back in so that `$PATH` and similar are appropriately updated with the
emergent setup.
