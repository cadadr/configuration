# Göktuğ's Systems

This tree contains system-level configurations specific to my computers.

## `itugen`: workstation

Debian based workstation with the MATE desktop.

## `ulgen`: laptop

A Linux Mint Cinnamon based laptop setup.  I use Linux Mint here
because manually configuring power management and plug-n-play is a
PITA.

## `ayata`: Raspberry Pi

A config for an RPi that acts as a networked printer / scanner /
backup server.
