# Göktuğ's Systems

This tree contains system-level configurations specific to my computers.

## `mergen`: desktop workstation

TBD.

## `ulgen`: laptop

A Linux Mint based laptop setup.  I use Linux Mint here because manually
configuring power management and plug-n-play is a PITA.

## `ayata`: Raspberry Pi

A config for an RPi that acts as a networked printer / scanner /
backup server.

## `tamag`: Windows desktop

TBD.
