# Göktuğ's Systems

This tree contains system-level configurations specific to my computers.

## `kayra`: desktop workstation

A workstation setup with Debian Stable and i3 window manager.  Partly
a port of `mergen`, partly a revival of my former Debian/i3 setup.

## `mergen`: desktop workstation

A Linux Mint Cinnamon based desktop workstation.  Someday might be
ported to GuixSD or NixOS.

`ulgen` and `mergen` should be mostly compatible.

## `ulgen`: laptop

A Linux Mint Cinnamon based laptop setup.  I use Linux Mint here
because manually configuring power management and plug-n-play is a
PITA.

## `ayata`: Raspberry Pi

A config for an RPi that acts as a networked printer / scanner /
backup server.

## `guixtest`: GuixSD workstation

This is an experimental configuration that tries to replicate `mergen`,
but built on the Guix System Distribution.

## `tamag`: Windows desktop

TBD.
