# Göktuğ's Systems

This tree contains system-level configurations specific to my computers.

## `umay`: desktop workstation

A Linux Mint Debian Edition Cinnamon based desktop workstation.

## `kayra`: desktop workstation

A workstation setup with Debian Stable and i3 window manager.  Partly
a port of `mergen` (now `umay`), partly a revival of my former
Debian/i3 setup.

Someday might be ported to GuixSD or NixOS.

## `guixtest`: GuixSD workstation

This is an experimental configuration that tries to replicate `kayra`,
but built on the Guix System Distribution.

## `ulgen`: laptop

A Linux Mint Cinnamon based laptop setup.  I use Linux Mint here
because manually configuring power management and plug-n-play is a
PITA.

## `ayata`: Raspberry Pi

A config for an RPi that acts as a networked printer / scanner /
backup server.

## `tamag`: Windows desktop

TBD.
