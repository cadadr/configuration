# This is a translation table for keyboard modifiers. The syntax is:
#
# (hardware key) -> (effective modifier)
#
# A modifier can be mapped to "none" to disable it. For example:
#
# Lalt -> none
#
# When using CapsLock as a modifier key, its toggled state will still affect
# text entry. You may need to remap or disable CapsLock in your window system.
#
# You may delete this file and it will be recreated with the default mapping.
