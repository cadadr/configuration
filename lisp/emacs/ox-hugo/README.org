[[https://travis-ci.org/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo][https://travis-ci.org/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo.svg?branch=master]] [[https://melpa.org/#/ox-hugo][file:https://melpa.org/packages/ox-hugo-badge.svg]] [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0][https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue.svg]]

[[https://gitter.im/KaushalModi/Lobby][https://badges.gitter.im/KaushalModi/Lobby.svg]] [[https://saythanks.io/to/kaushalmodi][https://img.shields.io/badge/Say%20Thanks-!-1EAEDB.svg]]

=ox-hugo= is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to
[[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]-compatible Markdown ([[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday][Blackfriday]]) and also generates the
front-matter (in TOML or YAML format).

The =ox-hugo= backend extends from a /parent/ backend
=ox-blackfriday.el=. The latter is the one that primarily does the
Blackfriday-friendly Markdown content generation. The main job of
=ox-hugo= is to generate the front-matter for each exported content
file, and then append that generated Markdown to it.

There are, though, few functions that =ox-hugo.el= overrides over
those by =ox-blackfriday.el=.

using =ox-hugo= and their Org sources.

* Screenshots
Before you read further, you can see below how =ox-hugo= translates
Org to Markdown (Org on the left; exported Markdown with Hugo
front-matter on the right).
** One post per Org subtree (preferred)
[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/static/images/one-post-per-subtree.png][https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/static/images/one-post-per-subtree.png]]

** One post per Org file
[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/static/images/one-post-per-file.png][https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/static/images/one-post-per-file.png]]

** Editorial
The preferred way to organize the posts is as Org subtrees (also the
main reason to write this package, as nothing like that was out there)
as it makes the meta-data management for Hugo front-matter pretty
effortless.

If you are a /one Org-file per post/ type of a person, that flow works
too! Just note that in this flow many of those =#+hugo_= properties
need to be managed manually.. just as one would manage the front-matter
in Markdown files --- See the Org versions in the above screenshots for
comparison.
* Documentation
=ox-hugo= uses *itself* to generate its documentation!

https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/

You can generate the same too! Simply clone this repo and do =make
doc_md=.

*Make sure you visit the above link to read more on:*
- [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/why-ox-hugo][Why =ox-hugo=?]]
- [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/auto-export-on-saving][Auto exporting to Markdown each time the Org file is saved]]
- [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/org-capture-setup][Using Org Capture to start a new blog post]]
- .. and many more topics and examples
** Source of the Documentation site
- [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/ox-hugo-manual.org][Org source]]

The documentation site is published by first using =ox-hugo= to
export from Org to Markdown, and then finally =hugo=.
/So no Markdown files are committed in the =doc/content/= directory./
* Demo
[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/test/site/content-org][Org source]] → [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/test/site/content][=ox-hugo= Exported Markdown]] → https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test

The test site uses a [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-bare-min-theme][minimal]] theme written just for debug purposes
(not extra aesthetics). The test site is designed to verify if all the
content translates from Org to Markdown as expected.

/See [[https://themes.gohugo.io/][Hugo Themes]] for examples of really good site prettification and
presentation styles./

* Installation
This package requires emacs 24.4+ and Org 9.0+. It is available on
Melpa ([[https://melpa.org/#/ox-hugo]]).
* Usage
Once the package is installed, you will need to /require/ it so that
the =ox-hugo= export options are available in the /Org Export
Dispatcher/ menu (the one you see when you hit =C-c C-e= to initiate
any export).

You can do that by adding the below to your config:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'ox
  (require 'ox-hugo))
#+END_SRC
If you use =use-package=, you can do the below instead:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package ox-hugo
  :after ox)
#+END_SRC

*Spacemacs*

Spacemacs users can choose to add this snippet to their
=dotspacemacs/user-config= function in =.spacemacs=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  ;; Other stuff
  ;; ..

  ;; ox-hugo config
  (use-package ox-hugo
    :ensure t                           ;Auto-install the package from Melpa
    :after ox))
#+END_SRC

If you do so, you *also need to* add =ox-hugo= to
=dotspacemacs-additional-packages=.

/Verified to work on Spacemacs =develop= branch with =spacemacs-base=
distribution, =emacs= editing style./
** Before you export
Before you export check that these properties are set as you need:
- HUGO_SECTION :: The default Hugo section name for all the posts.  See
  [[http://gohugo.io/content/sections/][here]] for more information on Hugo sections.  It is
  common for this property to be set to =posts= or
  =blog=.  The default value is set using
  =org-hugo-default-section-directory=.
- HUGO_BASE_DIR :: Root directory of the source for the Hugo site. If
  this is set to =~/hugo/=, the exported Markdown
  files will be saved to
  =~/hugo/content/<HUGO_SECTION>/= directory.  By
  default, the Markdown files reside in a hierarchy
  under the =content/= directory in the site root
  directory ([[http://gohugo.io/content/organization/][ref]]). If you try to export without
  setting this property, you will get this error:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    user-error: It is mandatory to set the HUGO_BASE_DIR property
  #+END_EXAMPLE

*Important*: If you choose to export an Org subtree as a post, you
 need to set the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= subtree property. That property is
 used by this package to figure out where the current post starts.
** Export bindings
The common =ox-hugo= export bindings are:
*** For both one-post-per-subtree and one-post-per-file flows
- =C-c C-e H H= :: Export "What I Mean".
  - If point is in a /valid Hugo post subtree/, export that
    subtree to a Hugo post in Markdown.

    A /valid Hugo post subtree/ is an Org subtree has the
    =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property set.
  - If the file is intended to be exported as a whole (i.e. has the
    =#+title= keyword), export the whole Org file to a Hugo post in
    Markdown.
- =C-c C-e H A= :: Export *all* "What I Mean"
  - If the Org file has one or more 'valid Hugo post subtrees', export
    them to Hugo posts in Markdown.
  - If the file is intended to be exported as a whole (i.e. no 'valid
    Hugo post subtrees' at all, and has the =#+title= keyword), export
    the whole Org file to a Hugo post in Markdown.
*** For only the one-post-per-file flow
- =C-c C-e H h= :: Export the Org file to a Hugo post in Markdown.
** Customization Options
Do =M-x customize-group=, and select =org-export-hugo= to see the
available customization options for this package.
* Changelog
** v0.8 <2018-01-26 Fri>
*** Features
- Support exporting content files and attachments (images, documents)
  to Page Bundles organization structure (Hugo v0.32+) --
  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/111][111]].
- Support exporting =resources= front-matter (Hugo v0.33+) --
  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/115][115]].
- Support exporting =headless= front-matter (Hugo v0.35+).
- Advanced table styling is now possible by specifying =#+attr_html=
  and =#+attr_css= (this one is unique to =ox-hugo=) above Org
  tables. See its [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/table-styling/][documentation]] -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/93][93]].
  - Similarly, support =#+attr_html= and =#+attr_css= for paragraphs,
    example blocks, source blocks, plain lists and quote blocks too --
    #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/113][113]].
- Now =publishDate= and =expiryDate= front-matter properties get
  auto-derived from =SCHEDULED= and =DEADLINE= special properties if
  associated with the valid Hugo post subtree --
  commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/0807f42d][0807f42d]].
  - Date values can now be easily set using the =C-c .= binding in the
    =HUGO_PUBLISHDATE= and =HUGO_EXPIRYDATE= properties too.
- Export source blocks and table captions -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/38][38]]. Here's a
  suggested CSS for the captions:
  #+BEGIN_SRC css
    figcaption,
    .src-block-caption,
    .table-caption {
        font-style: italic;
        text-align: center;
    }
  #+END_SRC
- Export descriptive or definition lists in Blackfriday-friendly
  Markdown format -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/114][114]].
- Support Org Special Blocks [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Special-blocks.html][like in HTML and LaTeX exports]] --
  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/105][105]]. Here's one little example:
  #+BEGIN_SRC org
    ,#+begin_mark
    /Some/ *marked* text
    ,#+end_mark
  #+END_SRC
- Allow setting =:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION:= in the valid Hugo post subtree
  itself.
- Enable replacing any key in the front-matter with anything; it's
  even possible to swap the keys now (tags↔categories:
  commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/fb21e82c][fb21e82c]]). New keyword:
  =HUGO_FRONT_MATTER_KEY_REPLACE= -- see commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/b72a5fb0][b72a5fb0]].
- Now all the Org keyword values that should get merged, get merged --
  commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/38eba6d5][38eba6d5]].
- Add =title= as a valid property of =menu= front-matter (Hugo
  v0.32+).
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- A "better user-experience" change.. now you do not need to use
  /double-underscores/ as /space/ replacement in =#+hugo_tags=,
  =#+hugo_categories= and =#+keywords=. See this commit for details
  and examples -- commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/319435db][319435db]].
*** Fixes
- Fix =HUGO_LEVEL_OFFSET= not getting set -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/117][117]], thanks
  @[[https://github.com/shimmy1996][*shimmy1996*]]!
- Fix internal subtree counter not getting reset after a file-based
  export.
- Fix clickable image links with =#+name= -- commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/fef0ec50][fef0ec50]].
- Make title text rendering more robust.. now Markdown markup
  characters like =*=, =_= and =`= show up fine, verbatim, in the
  title.
- Make em dash, en dash, horizontal ellipsis render in post titles
  too -- Hugo #[[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4175][4175]] (/Upstream bug fix/), and in source
  block captions and table captions too.
- Fix double-escaping of =#= and =![= in Markdown export --
  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/110][110]] (/fix in upstream =ox-md.el=/).
*** Meta
- Re-write the logic for parsing meta-data for various kinds of dates,
  and optimize the logic for parsing newline separated lists like tags
  and categories.
- The =bare_min= theme used for the test site is made more portable
  (at some point, that theme might be moved to a separate repo).
** v0.7 <2017-12-18 Mon>
*** Features
- *Now C-c C-e H H works for both per-subtree and per-file flows* --
  commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/b1b5d28b][b1b5d28b]].
- Support Org heading based internal links -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/88][88]].
- Support list values for custom front-matter variables --
  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/99][99]].
- Support specifying multiple [[https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats/][hugo output formats]] .. Now the =outputs=
  front-matter variable is a list.
- Support the Org =#+author= and =#+creator= keywords and their
  respective Org Export Options -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/106][106]].
- Support Org Export Snippets and Export Blocks --
  commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/1149f20cd][1149f20cd]].
- Now post titles can be set to =nil= i.e. be not be a part of the
  front-matter .. /because you can/.
- Improve the messages printed by =ox-hugo= on doing per-subtree or
  per-file exports.. the progress of files exported using per-subtree
  flow is now clearer, and the name of the file exported using
  per-file flow is now explicit.. Helps when you batch export a dozen
  files with a mix of these 2 flows.
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Obsolete /org-hugo-export-subtree-\ast{}/ functions and replace them with
  /org-hugo-export-wim-\ast{}/ (What I Mean) functions. See the doc string
  of =org-hugo-export-wim-to-md= for details.

  If you are using the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/auto-export-on-saving/][Auto-export on saving]] flow, note the function
  name change there too!
*** Fixes
- Fix number of backticks in code fence when code contains code fence
  (/pathological corner case/).
- Better document the =HUGO_CODE_FENCE= keyword -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/102][102]].
- Don't render =(c)=, =(r)=, =(tm)= inside Latex equations --
  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/104][104]] (/Upstream bug workaround/).
- Better recognition of TOML-compatible integers and floats in meta
  data for front-matter so that valid integers/floats don't get
  unnecessarily double-quoted.
*** Meta
- Add a [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/blob/master/test/site/themes/bare_min/layouts/partials/debugprint.html][=debugprint.html=]] partial to help pretty-print various Hugo
  objects like Page Params, File and SiteInfo for debug on the test
  site.
- The test site now has [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/tags/][tags]] and [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/categories/][categories]] pages.
- Add few real world example posts containing complex Latex equations:
  [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/real-examples/multifractals-in-ecology-using-r/][1]], [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/real-examples/nn-intro/][2]].
- Turns out =ox-hugo= works on emacs 24.4 too (/but please upgrade
  to the latest Emacs and Org stable versions!/).
** v0.6 <2017-11-09 Thu>
*** Features
- Support the =num= export option. Now you can prefix all post
  headings (or some not.. the ones with =UNNUMBERED= property set to
  =t=) with their section numbers -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/76][76]].
- Org TOC's are now exported as unordered Markdown lists. This allows
  having TOC's with unnumbered headings too! This also enables
  prefixing the section headings with their full section numbers, and
  also having only selected headings unnumbered (both in the post body
  and the TOC).
- Add support for exporting internal links to source blocks, tables
  and images by their block names! -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/29][29]].
- Org table column alignment markers (=<l>=, =<r>=, =<c>=) are now
  exported to equivalent Markdown tables.. so a center-aligned column
  in Org buffer will remain center-aligned in the final HTML too! --
  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/95][95]].
- Allow setting multiple Hugo aliases for a post. Also infer the
  section name from inherited =HUGO_SECTION= values (subtree-based
  exports) for those alias prefixes.
- Prevent a footnote ref to appear by itself on a newline (based on
  wrapping) in the browser -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/96][96]].
- If Hugo shortcodes are used specifically in Markdown (=md=) source
  blocks, they will be auto-escaped (useful when you want to
  document/talk about some Hugo shortcode in a blog post) --
  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/94][94]].
- If an Org table has just 1 row, don't make it render as a header row
  in the final HTML.
- If you have a case where you need to have an Org source block
  instead a quote block, and then a source block after that quote
  block (/I know, a very common case../ :wink:), Blackfriday barfs
  (Blackfriday # [[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday/issues/407][407]]). But we now have a workaround, which /just
  works/ -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/98][98]].
- Now =ATTR_HTML= above even hyper-linked images works (earlier it
  worked only above non-hyper-linked images).
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Org TOC's are exported as unordered Markdown lists instead of
  ordered Markdown lists, and now full section numbers (like 1.2.3)
  are shown in the TOC instead of just the last digit (like 3.) --
  commit [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/4be378e7][4be378e7]].
- The =num= Org export option is default to =nil= (only for
  =ox-hugo=). So Org TOC's are exported without section numbers by
  default. To get section numbers, set =num= to =t= or =onlytoc=.
*** Fixes
- Now exporting 1-row Org tables works too.
- Add missing http/https/ftp prefix for hyper-linked images.
*** Meta
- Add documentation on how you can have
  [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/images-in-content][Images live in the same directory as Org
  source]] -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/91][91]].
- Now only Org files for the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][documentation site]] need to be committed
  to git. =ox-hugo= then exports those to Markdown, and then Hugo
  publishes those to HTML (as before) --- all on Netlify.
- Be sure to check out the moderately revamped [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/][Test Site]]. That might
  be of interest even if you want to check out what the new features
  and changes look like, without first installing/updating =ox-hugo=
  yourself :smile:.
** v0.5 <2017-11-06 Mon>
*** Features
- Export TOC as a Markdown ordered list. See [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/org-toc][Table of
  Contents]] -- #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/88][88]].
- =#+attr_html= above http/https/ftp links is now supported (useful
  for specifying the =target=, =rel=, attributes, for example).
** v0.4.1 <2017-10-29 Sun>
*** Features
- Support specifying the =:height= parameter in the =#+attr_html=
  above image links. That eventually gets transformed to the =height=
  parameter in the =figure= tag in the HTML generated by Hugo. This
  feature requires building Hugo from its master branch with commit
  [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/488631fe0abc3667355345c7eb98ba7a2204deb5][488631fe]] (or Hugo v0.31+).
*** Fixes
- Fix =EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION= not getting inherited #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/90][90]].
** v0.4 <2017-10-28 Sat>
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Restore the default Org behavior of =#+tags=. Now that keyword (and
  the =EXPORT_TAGS= property) is *not* used by =ox-hugo=. Fixes
  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/89][89]].
- File-based exports must now use =#+hugo_tags= to set the post tags.
- Subtree-based exports can use the =EXPORT_HUGO_TAGS= property to
  override Org-style tags on the same headline (and the ones inherited
  from Org-style tags from any of the parent subtrees and
  =#+filetags=).
  - Note that for subtree-based exports, =#+filetags= can be used to
    set tags globally in the file. Earlier =#+tags= was used for that
    purpose.
- Subtree-based exports can use the =EXPORT_HUGO_CATEGORIES= property
  to override Org-style categories (tags with "@" prefix) on the same
  headline (and the ones inherited from Org-style categories from any
  of the parent subtrees and =#+filetags=).
  - Note that for subtree-based exports, =#+filetags= can be used to
    set categories (tags with "@") globally in the file.

See the new section added to documentation:
[[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/tags-and-categories][*Tags and Categories*]]
*** Features
- Support specifying the =:width= parameter in the =#+attr_html= above
  image links. That eventually gets transformed to the =width=
  parameter in the =figure= tag in the HTML generated by Hugo.
** v0.3.2 <2017-10-24 Tue>
*** Fixes
- Fix issue with headline metadata parsing (ALLTAGS, CLOSED, TODO)
  when a post Org heading was immediately followed by that post's
  sub-heading.  This issue was seen in subtree-based exports
  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/87][87]].
** v0.3.1 <2017-10-19 Thu>
*** Fixes
- Fix the source block line number annotation when the line numbers
  increased in number of digits in the same code block.
** v0.3 <2017-10-18 Wed>
*** Features
- Source blocks can now be exported with line numbers and/or
  highlighting!

  See [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/source-blocks][Source Blocks]] for details.
** v0.2.3 <2017-10-11 Wed>
*** Fixes
- =org-hugo-slug= earlier stripped off only the =code= HTML tag
  (~<code> .. </code>~) from the input string, if present. Now it does
  that for *any* HTML tag, like =span=. For example, this HTML gets
  stripped off from the above heading (only inside =org-hugo-slug=
  when deriving the slug string): ~<span
    class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2017-10-11
    Wed&gt;</span></span>~.
** v0.2.2 <2017-10-10 Tue>
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Now =ox-hugo= by default requires text, to be sub/super-scripted, to
  be wrapped in ={}=. So now =a_b= will be exported as =a_b=, but
  =a_{b}= will be exported as =a<sub>b</sub>=. To revert back to the
  earlier behavior, user needs to add =#+options: ^:t= to their Org
  file.
** v0.2.1 <2017-09-28 Thu>
*** Fixes
- Single column tables now export correctly #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/84][84]].
- Ignore =HUGO_WEIGHT= set to =auto= for /per-file/ exports
  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/83][83]].
** v0.2 <2017-09-27 Wed>
*** Features
- Add support for all Hugo =figure= shortcode parameters
  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/79][79]].
- New option =org-hugo-delete-trailing-ws= defaults to =t=; now Hugo
  deletes trailing white-spaces by default.
- New options =org-hugo-default-static-subdirectory-for-externals= and
  =org-hugo-external-file-extensions-allowed-for-copying= (related to
  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/69][69]]).
*** Fixes
- Remove =HUGO_STATIC_IMAGE= option; fix attachment re-write
  #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/69][69]].
- Fix incorrectly inserted hard line-breaks #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/72][72]]. Added a
  new option =HUGO_PRESERVE_FILLING=.
- Fix error happening when a post title was set to an empty string
  [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/ba9e8365f6ee42f030ed806bf5ec42d6acce4c76][ba9e8365]]].
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Switch the default value of =org-hugo-use-code-for-kbd= option to
  =nil= [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/88ba15ae9bc809b0983315446c88fecfda3534e5][88ba15ae]]].
** v0.1.3 <2017-09-13 Wed>
- Now a HUGO key value set to ="nil"=, like =#+hugo_code_fence: nil=,
  will evaluate as /nil/ instead of /t/, as now
  =org-hugo--plist-get-true-p= is used to parse boolean keys instead
  of =plist-get=.
** v0.1.2 <2017-09-12 Tue>
- Make DateTime matching better; new internal variable
  =org-hugo--date-time-regexp=. Earlier time zones ahead of UTC (with
  =+= sign) were not detected as dates in =org-hugo--quote-string= and
  thus were unnecessarily quoted.
** v0.1.1 <2017-09-11 Mon>
- Use CLOSED log drawer info if available to set the date in
  front-matter #[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/68][68]].
- Code optimization: Use of =org-entry-get= at places instead of
  maintaining global variables.
