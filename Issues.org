* BUG =gk-org-insert-reading-note= should filter out common ligatures
[2022-10-14 Cum]

Those like =fi, ff, ffi, fl, ti= etc that evil people put in their
PDFs.

* FEAT Write an ISBN to BibTeX tool like doifetch.el
[2022-08-25 Prş]

Can take [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref/blob/master/org-ref-isbn.el][this component of org-ref]] as a basis.

* FEAT Fetch Sci-Hub PDF easily with a keybinding in Ebib
[2022-08-25 Prş]

Use =gk-scihub-pdf= to create a keybinding in ebib to fetch Sci-Hub
pdfs for current item if there's no associated file.

* RSC Integrate and use shellcheck
[2022-08-19 Cum]

[[https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck][Shellcheck]] is a linter for bourne shell. I should integrate it to
Emacs and use it retroactively for the shell scripts I have.

* FEAT Rewrite dconf-dump.bash in Python
[2022-06-28 Sal]

The filtering with bash&grep sucks because the format is =.ini=.

If ported to Python (which has built-in =.ini= support in its standard
library), I can filter it as a data structure which means I can use
more granular filters.

* BUG Shell alias "refresh" breaks =$PATH=
[2022-04-24 Paz]

It apparently does not source scripts in =$HOME/.config/profile.d=.

* RSC Stop using Raspbian on xanthippe
[2021-02-05 Cum]

RPi foundation has sneaked in Microsoft repos into sources.list
without consent, and without marking it non-free.
