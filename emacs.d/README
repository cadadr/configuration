My Emacs Setup
==============

This is my emacs setup.

The basic structure is as follows:

~/.emacs.d
├ init.el
│   The init file.
├ site/
│   Third-party little elisp files that provide additional
│   functionality.
├ gk/
│   My setup, can be loaded by simply (require 'gk).
│ lisp/
│   Various programs that are not loaded unless needed. Not in
│   loadpath.
├ extras/
│   Various non-elisp programmes that are used by my emacs
│   setup.
├ packages/
│   Third-party packages.
├ eshell/
│   Eshell config.
├ themes/
│   Custom themes
└ etc
  ├ custom.el
  │   M-x Customize settings.
  └ load-test.el
      Used by gk-test-init, test whether emacs loads successfully.
