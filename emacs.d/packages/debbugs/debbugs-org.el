;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides an interface to bug reports which are located
;; on the GNU bug tracker debbugs.gnu.org.  Its main purpose is to
;; show and manipulate bug reports as org-mode TODO items.

;; If you have `debbugs-org.el' in your load-path, you could enable
;; the bug tracker commands by the following lines in your ~/.emacs
;;
;;   (autoload 'debbugs-org "debbugs-org" "" 'interactive)
;;   (autoload 'debbugs-org-search "debbugs-org" "" 'interactive)
;;   (autoload 'debbugs-org-patches "debbugs-org" "" 'interactive)
;;   (autoload 'debbugs-org-bugs "debbugs-org" "" 'interactive)

;; The bug tracker is called interactively by
;;
;;   M-x debbugs-org

;; It asks for the severities, for which bugs shall be shown. This can
;; be either just one severity, or a list of severities, separated by
;; comma.  Valid severities are "serious", "important", "normal",
;; "minor" or "wishlist".  Severities "critical" and "grave" are not
;; used, although configured on the GNU bug tracker.  If no severity
;; is given, all bugs are selected.

;; There is also the pseudo severity "tagged".  When it is used, the
;; function will ask for user tags (a comma separated list), and shows
;; just the bugs which are tagged with them.  In general, user tags
;; shall be strings denoting to subprojects of the package, like
;; "cedet" or "tramp" of the package "emacs".  If no user tag is
;; given, locally tagged bugs are shown.

;; If a prefix is given to the command, more search parameters are
;; asked for, like packages (also a comma separated list, "emacs" is
;; the default), whether archived bugs shall be shown, and whether
;; closed bugs shall be suppressed from being retrieved.

;; Another command is
;;
;;   M-x debbugs-org-search

;; It behaves like `debbugs-org', but asks at the beginning for a
;; search phrase to be used for full text search.  Additionally, it
;; asks for key-value pairs to filter bugs.  Keys are as described in
;; `debbugs-get-status', the corresponding value must be a regular
;; expression to match for.  The other parameters are as described in
;; `debbugs-org'.

;; The bug reports are downloaded from the bug tracker.  In order to
;; not generate too much load of the server, up to 500 bugs will be
;; downloaded at once.  If there are more hits, several downloads will
;; be performed, until all bugs are retrieved.

;; These default values could be changed also by customer options
;; `debbugs-gnu-default-severities' and `debbugs-gnu-default-packages'.

;; The commands create a TODO list.  Besides the usual handling of
;; TODO items, you could apply the following actions by the following
;; keystrokes:

;;   "C-c # C": Send a debbugs control message
;;   "C-c # t": Mark the bug locally as tagged
;;   "C-c # d": Show bug attributes

;; The last entry in a TODO record is the link [[Messages]].  If you
;; follow this link, a Gnus ephemeral group or an Rmail buffer is
;; opened presenting all related messages for this bug.  Here you
;; could also send debbugs control messages by keystroke "C".

;; A special command to show bugs containing patches is
;;
;;   M-x debbugs-org-patches

;; This command shows all unarchived bugs of the packages declared in
;; `debbugs-gnu-default-packages', and tagged with "patch".  This is
;; useful for bug triages.

;; Finally, if you simply want to list some bugs with known bug
;; numbers, call the command
;;
;;   M-x debbugs-org-bugs

;; The bug numbers to be shown shall be entered as comma separated
;; list.  A bug number can also be a range of bugs like "123-456" or
;; "-10".  In the former case, all bugs from 123 until 456 are
;; presented, and in the latter case the last 10 bugs are shown,
;; counting from the highest bug number in the repository.
