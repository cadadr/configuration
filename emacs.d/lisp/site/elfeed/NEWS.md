# Changes

## 3.4.0 (2021-01-30)

* New search filter: ~ excludes matching feeds

* Support fetching feeds via file://

* Support fetching feeds via the Gopher protocol

* "End of entries" no longer appears in elfeed-search

* Support bookmarks in entries

* New customizations: elfeed-show-entry-switch, elfeed-show-entry-delete

* More extensive information from elfeed-curl-get-capabilities

* New elfeed-show command: elfeed-kill-link-url-at-point (c)

* Various other minor behavior improvements

## 3.3.0 (2019-11-23)

* New option: `elfeed-search-remain-on-entry`.

* More graceful handling of feed filters (=).

* Fix minor time handling issue with Emacs >= 26.1

* Load bookmarks before trying to use them.

## 3.2.0 (2019-08-24)

* Support for absolute date/time expressions in filters. See README.md
  for documentation and examples.

* curl's `--disable` is now default. To load your .curlrc file, use
  `--config` explicitly in `elfeed-curl-extra-arguments`.

* Re-enable curl's HTTP/2 support.

* Function `elfeed-next-link` was renamed to `elfeed-show-next-link`.

* New search buffer bindings: <, >, h, c

* Multiple authors are now parsed from entries. Reflecting this, the
  meta key for authors is now `:authors` instead of `:author`. The
  value is always a list of zero or more authors.

* New variable: `elfeed-show-unique-buffers`. Allows for displaying
  multiple show buffers at the same time.

* Various minor fixes and improvements.

## 3.1.0 (2018-08-29)

* Add `elfeed-show-enclosure-filename-function` for controlling
  enclosure filenames.

* Dynamically enable/disable --compressed curl option. On some systems
  curl is built without this option, so it causes errors when it is
  used.

* Minor documentation fixes.

## 3.0.0 (2018-05-13)

* Under Emacs 26, there is a new database index format (version 4).

Emacs 26 introduces a new "record" type, and cl-defstruct objects used
by Elfeed as its database format are now based on this type. This
unfortunately changes (and breaks) Elfeed's index format. Prior to this
release, Emacs 26 could not open an Emacs 24–25 index and vice versa.

As of Elfeed 2.4.0, Elfeed running under Emacs 26 will automatically and
quietly upgrade an Emacs 25 database index for Emacs 26. **THIS UPGRADE
IS IRREVERSIBLE** and the database can no longer be used with Emacs 25.
A one-time backup copy ("index.backup") of the original Emacs 25 index
is created before performing the upgrade. If Emacs 25, whether running
this or any prior Elfeed release, loads the new database format, it will
see an empty database as if starting from scratch.

## 2.3.1 (2018-05-13)

* The index is now saved when quitting the elfeed-search window ("q").
* `elfeed-link` is now autoloaded.

* New hook: `elfeed-search-update-hook`

* New variable: `elfeed-search-sort-function`
* Connect curl with a pipe instead of a pty—a performance boost
