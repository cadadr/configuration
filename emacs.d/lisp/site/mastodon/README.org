Emacs client for [[https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon][Mastodon]]

[[http://spacemacs.org][https://cdn.rawgit.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/442d025779da2f62fc86c2082703697714db6514/assets/spacemacs-badge.svg]]

** Installation

Clone this repository and add the lisp directory to your load path.
Then, require it and go.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mastodon.el/lisp")
    (require 'mastodon)
#+END_SRC

Or, with =use-package=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mastodon
    :load-path "/path/to/mastodon.el/lisp")
#+END_SRC

*** MELPA

Add =MELPA= to your archives:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

Update and install:

=M-x package-refresh-contents RET=

=M-x package-install RET mastodon RET=

*** Emoji

=mastodon-mode= will enable [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify][Emojify]] if it is loaded in your Emacs environment, so
there's no need to write your own hook anymore. =emojify-mode= is not required.

*** Discover

=mastodon-mode= will provide a context menu for its keybindings if [[https://github.com/mickeynp/discover.el][Discover]] is 
installed. It is not required.

** Usage
*** 2 Factor Auth
2FA is not supported yet. It is in the [[https://github.com/jdenen/mastodon.el/milestone/2][plans]] for the =1.0.0= release.

If you have 2FA enabled and try to use mastodon.el, your Emacs client will hang until you `C-g` your way out.
*** Instance

Set =mastodon-instance-url= in your =.emacs= or =customize=. Defaults to the [[https://mastodon.social][flagship]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq mastodon-instance-url "https://my.instance.url")
#+END_SRC

*** Timelines

=M-x mastodon=

Opens a =*mastodon-home*= buffer in the major mode so you can see toots. You will be prompted for email and password. The app registration process will take place if your =mastodon-token-file= does not contain =:client_id= and =:client_secret=.

**** Legend

|--------+-------------------------|
| Marker | Meaning                 |

| =(B)=  | I boosted this toot.    |
| =(F)=  | I favourited this toot. |
|--------+-------------------------|

*** Toot toot

=M-x mastodon-toot=

Pops a new buffer/window with a =mastodon-toot= minor mode. Enter the
contents of your toot here. =C-c C-c= sends the toot. =C-c C-k= cancels. 
Both actions kill the buffer and window.

If you have not previously authenticated, you will be prompted for your
account email and password. *NOTE*: Email and password are NOT stored by mastodon.el.

Authentication stores your access token in the =mastodon-auth--token= 
variable. It is not stored on your filesystem, so you will have to 
re-authenticate when you close/reopen Emacs.

**** Keybindings

|-----------+---------------------|
| Key       | Action              |
|-----------+---------------------|
| =C-c C-c= | Send toot           |
| =C-c C-k= | Cancel toot         |
| =C-c C-w= | Add content warning |
