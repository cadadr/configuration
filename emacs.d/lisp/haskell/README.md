Users manual: [latest version](http://haskell.github.io/haskell-mode/manual/latest/), older versions: [13.12](http://haskell.github.io/haskell-mode/manual/13.12/), [13.14](http://haskell.github.io/haskell-mode/manual/13.14/), [13.16](http://haskell.github.io/haskell-mode/manual/13.16/), [13.18](http://haskell.github.io/haskell-mode/manual/13.18/), [13.20](http://haskell.github.io/haskell-mode/manual/13.20/).


## Quick Installation

Make sure you have this in your [init file](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html) (usually `~/.emacs`). If you already have `custom-set-variables`, merge its contents:

```elisp
(require 'package)
(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(package-archives
   (quote
    (("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
     ("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/")))))
(package-initialize)
```

Then run emacs, and evaluate:

    M-x package-refresh-contents

and then follow by

    M-x package-install RET haskell-mode

Voila! `haskell-mode` is installed! You should be able to edit Haskell
source code in color now.

`Haskell-mode` has much much much more to offer but the above should get you
going!


## Advanced configuration

For setup instructions, please consult the integrated `haskell-mode`
[Info](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/texinfo.html)
manual which can be accessed after installation via `M-x
info-display-manual [RET] haskell-mode`.  Alternatively, you can also
direct your browser to the
[the online haskell-mode manual](http://haskell.github.io/haskell-mode/manual/latest/)
for setup and user guide.


## Installation - more information

`haskell-mode` supports GNU Emacs version 24.3 or later.

`haskell-mode` is available from [melpa-stable](http://stable.melpa.org) (releases) and [melpa](http://melpa.org)
(git snapshots).

Other means of obtaining `haskell-mode` include
[el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get),
[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) and [Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=haskell-mode).

## Installation from git repository

Running `haskell-mode` directly from sources is easy but
requires a little preparation:

- `git clone https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode.git` into a
  suitable directory, e.g. `~/lib/emacs/haskell-mode/` where `~`
  stands for your home directory.

- Assuming you have unpacked the various haskell-mode modules
  (`haskell-mode.el` and the rest) in the directory
  `~/lib/emacs/haskell-mode/`, you need to generate various files, the
  autoloads file (`haskell-mode-autoloads.el`) is one among
  them. Invoke:

```bash
make EMACS=/path/to/your/emacs
```

  and then adding the following command to your `.emacs`:

```el
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/lib/emacs/haskell-mode/")
(require 'haskell-mode-autoloads)
(add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "~/lib/emacs/haskell-mode/")
```

### Installation from git repository on macOS

There are a couple of things to note if you want to install directly from
git on macOS systems, as of version 10.13 High Sierra: 

- The version of makeinfo that is installed by
  default in /usr/bin is quite old and will cause the above make 
  command to exit with an error. Installing the texinfo package using
  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) will fix this. Be sure to follow the post-install instructions
  to add its bin directory to your shell's PATH variable.

- If you are running an Emacs distribution packaged as a macOS application. such as
  the one available at https://emacsformacosx.com/, you'll need to add its executable
  to your PATH before the system's default Emacs version. That project's
  [Tips and Tricks](https://emacsformacosx.com/tips) page has detailed instructions.

## Contributing

If you followed the above you are just a couple of steps away from
contributing to `haskell-mode`.

`haskell-mode` is actively seeking contributions from users of
`haskell-mode`. For more information have a look at
[the wiki page on contributing](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode/wiki/Contributing).
