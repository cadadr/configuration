- Use '#!/usr/bin/env bash' instead of '#!/bin/sh' because the scripts might
  use features that are only available in bash and not in POSIX /bin/sh.
- Avoid the variable name SECONDS in msmtp-runqueue.sh because it is predefined
  by bash.

2008-06-12:
- Fix msmtp-runqueue.sh. An error made while applying the previous patch
  accidently broke it. Reported by Thomas Weber. Thanks!

2008-01-27:
- Print the recipients of a mail in msmtp-runqueue.sh. Patch by Konrad
  Schrempf. Thanks!

2008-01-25:
- Pass options from msmtp-runqueue.sh to msmtp. Patch by Thomas Weber. Thanks!

Version 0.5:
- Added the msmtp-listqueue.sh script, contributed by Andreas Kneib.

Version 0.4:
- Frank Thieme sent the following improvements:
  - msmtp-runqueue.sh now uses a lock file to prevent two instances of the
    script from running simultaneously.
  - msmtp-enqueue.sh now checks if you're online, and calls msmtp-runqueue.sh
    immediately if this is the case.
    This functionality is commented out; you have to adapt the online check to
    your system before activating it.
