Scripts to queue mails and send them all at a later point with msmtp.

These scripts may be useful for dialup connections: You can "send" all your
mails offline (they will be queued by msmtp-enqueue.sh) and really send them
all later when you are online (by running msmtp-runqueue.sh).

1. msmtp-enqueue.sh
   Let your MUA "send" mails with this script.
   It will store all mails in a queue directory for later delivery.
   This script will save two files for each mail: one contains the mail, the
   other one contains the command line for msmtp (including options and the
   recipients). Thus you can use all msmtp options with this script.
   
   Example (using Mutt):
     In your Mutt configuration file, replace 
     set sendmail="/path/to/msmtp [options]"
     with
     set sendmail="/path/to/msmtp-enqueue.sh [options]"
   
   This script cannot detect errors in its command line or the msmtp
   configuration file. You won't see error messages before msmtp-runqueue.sh 
   runs msmtp to send the mails. So test your msmtp configuration before using
   msmtp-enqueue.sh.

2. msmtp-runqueue.sh
   Run this script when you are online to send all mails in the queue
   directory.
   It will use the saved msmtp command line for each mail.
   Mails sent successfully will be deleted from the queue directory.
   Mails whose delivery failed will be left untouched; you may want to edit
   them, delete them by hand or simply run msmtp-runqueue.sh at a later time.

3. msmtp-listqueue.sh
   This script lists all the mails in the queue.

Notes:
- If you want to change the queue directory, change the value of QUEUEDIR
  in *all* scripts.
- The scripts expect exclusive access to the queue directory. Don't save other
  files in it!
- Each mail will be saved in a file called cc-yy-mm-hh.mm.ss[-x].mail where
  cc-yy-mm is the current date, hh.mm.ss is the current time, and x is a
  consecutive number only appended if you send more than one mail per second.
  The msmtp command line will be saved in a file called
  cc-yy-mm-hh.mm.ss[-x].msmtp (the same file name with ".msmtp" instead of
  ".mail").

These scripts are simple and dumb. Change them to meet your requirements!
Please send any improvements you make to <marlam@marlam.de> for inclusion in
later versions.
