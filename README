* Introduction

This repo contains the following:

- My GNU Emacs configuration tree (~emacs.d/~)
- My dotfiles (~dotfiles/~)
- A debian package for my Debian/Ubuntu desktop (~deb/~), which helps
  install all the programs I use; and relevant configuration files
  (~system/debian~, ~system/ubuntu~)
- My configuration for Raspberry Pi (~rpi/~, ~system/rpi~)
- My userscripts (~www/~)
- My (incomplete) configuration for Guix(SD) (~guix/~)
- My setup for XFCE and other Xubuntu apps (~xdg-config/~); and also
  i3 desktop (~xdg-config/i3*~)
- And some other stuff.

I've re-created this Mercurial repository from scratch, removing some
secrets for publishing.  If you want to use any part of my
configurations, you're free to do so, but *do not* try to use it as
is, it's complex and personal, and some additional secret stuff is not
included, so it won't work reliably.  Just cherry-pick what you want.
