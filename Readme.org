Welcome to Göktuğ's Configuration, a work of artisanal love and care
aimed at making the personal computer use a joyful activity, instead
of endless agony and trade-offs in the era of inconfigurable apps
designed with biblical unquestionable dogmas imposed on the users by
the people that go by the D-word as their job title.  My computer is
my atelier, not an exhibition, so I demand that I'm able to touch,
move and modify anything in any way.

This repo contains the following:

- My GNU Emacs configuration tree (~emacs.d/~)
- My dotfiles (~dotfiles/~,  ~xdg-config/~)
- My configuration for a Kubuntu system (~kubuntu~)
- My configuration for Raspberry Pi (~rpi/~)
- And some other stuff.

I've re-created this repository from scratch, removing some secrets
for publishing.  If you want to use any part of my configurations,
you're free to do so, but *do not* try to use it as is, it's complex
and personal, and some additional secret stuff is not included, so it
won't work reliably.  Just cherry-pick what you want.

Lots of files created by other people are included in this repository,
most of the time verbatim.  Any file that does not include a statement
for its licence terms is probably written by me, and I hereby put all
of them in public domain.

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
